Required technologies:
- React Native (you can use Expo if you want)
- react-navigation for navigation system

Other than that, you can use any library you want to implement the booking list and the mock API logic, as long as it conforms with the requirements below.

1. Login
- Submit button is only enabled when both the email and password are filled
- Navigates to Home screen when pressing submit button
- No validations or API calls needed 
2. Home
- Each booking has:
  + Sport: can either be “Acrobatics”, “Dance”, “Archery” or “Yoga”, each sport has it’s own icon
  + Start datetime
  + End datetime
- Bookings should be grouped and sectioned by start date
- Should be an infinite scrolling list, each time we load 25 new bookings
- The list must have high performance, even with many items loaded
- Mock an API in the code to return bookings:
  + The sport is randomized between 4 available sports: Acrobatics, Dance, Archery, Yoga, each sport has it’s own icon
  + The start date should be increasingly further away into the future the more you scroll down
  + The start time is randomized within [0:00] to [23:55], only 5-minute intervals are allowed, for example 10:15
  + The end date must be the same as start date
  + The end time is randomized within [start time] to [24:00], only 5-minute intervals are allowed, for example 12:25
  + The amount of bookings per date is randomized between 1 and 3
  + The starting date of the first booking in the list should be 16 December 2024

Last but not least features:
- You setup a theme system where the colors can be easily replaced, or switch between dark/light mode
- You add email validations to Login screen with error toasts in the top right
- You use a time library that can handle time zones to generate and format the time on bookings
